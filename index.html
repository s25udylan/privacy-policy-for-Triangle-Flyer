    Privacy Policy

Effective Date: July 1, 2025

This privacy policy applies to the Triangle Flyer mobile application (the "App").

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This privacy policy explains our policies and procedures on the collection, use, and disclosure of your information when you use the App.
Information Collection and Use

We do not collect any personally identifiable information from our users. The App is a casual game and is designed to be used without the need to collect, store, or share any personal data.

The App does not require you to provide any personal information to download, install, or use it.
Log Data & Device Information

The App does not collect or transmit any log data, device information, or other technical information from your device.
Third-Party Services

The App does not use any third-party services that would collect information from you. Any distribution platforms where the App is available (like the Google Play Store) are governed by their own respective privacy policies.
Children's Privacy

Since we do not collect any personal information, we do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. The App is intended for a general audience.
Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
